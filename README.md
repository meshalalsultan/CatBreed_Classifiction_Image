# Cat Breed Classification Using Teachable Machine Project Overview
 Classify Cat Breed from image 

This project demonstrates the feasibility of creating an AI model for classifying cat breeds without extensive programming knowledge and within a short timeframe. The project utilizes Teachable Machine, a Google platform designed for building custom machine learning models without requiring coding expertise.

## Objectives
1- The primary objectives of this project are:

2- To develop a cat breed classification model using Teachable Machine.

3- To achieve satisfactory classification accuracy without extensive programming knowledge.

4- To complete the entire process, from data acquisition to model evaluation, within a timeframe of 30 minutes.

## Data Acquisition
The project employs a dataset of cat images from Kaggle's "Gano Cat Breed Image Collection" repository. This dataset provides a diverse range of cat breed images for training the model.

### Model Training
Using Teachable Machine, the project manually feeds the collected cat images along with their corresponding breed labels. This training process takes approximately 10 minutes.

### Model Evaluation
Once the training is complete, the trained model is evaluated using test images. The results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately classify cat breeds.

### Project Significance
The project highlights the potential of Teachable Machine as a tool for creating AI models without extensive programming knowledge. It also showcases the ability to achieve satisfactory results within a short timeframe of 30 minutes. This project serves as an example of how individuals with limited coding experience can leverage user-friendly platforms like Teachable Machine to explore the field of machine learning and create practical AI applications.
